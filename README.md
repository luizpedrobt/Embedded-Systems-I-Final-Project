# Embedded-Systems-I-Final-Project
This repository contains the firmware and hardware for a final project in the Embedded Systems I course.
The project idea was to create a heart rate and oximetry monitor using the MAX30100 sensor, with an STM32 as the controller.

I hereby clarify that, despite the board being duly suited for acquiring the cardiac signal, this project was developed solely for a university assignment and lacks regulation and reliability for use in a medical setting. THEREFORE, ITS USAGE IS RESTRICTED SOLELY TO ACADEMIC ENVIRONMETS.
